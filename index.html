                <p>"For most of my life, I had no relationship with style and clothes," says author Kirthana Ramisetti. "Trying them on
                always made me feel bad. But fashion plays a central role in my latest novel, and while writing it, I realized I deserve
                to find clothes that make me feel good." Today, Kirthana shares five colorful looks, plus a mother-and-daughter ritual
                and style tips from the Girls5Eva costume designer...</p>

                        <p class="p1">A CoJ reader named Apple asked a question that I can’t stop thinking about…
                        
                        “Can Cup of Jo PLEASE write another baby name post?? I know Jo is maybe no longer in the baby name zone, but there are
                        so many readers who would appreciate a chance to get name ideas from other readers — myself included!”</p>
                        <p class="p2">*Well*, I, too, have been hanging in the baby name department because coming this October,
                            <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2025/02/27/how-do-you-make-your-partner-feel-good/" >my husband Max</a> and I will be
                        welcoming our third baby, a sweet little girl! We are so excited, and these days all we talk about is who we think our
                        new little nugget will resemble, how Emiliano is going to adjust to being a big brother, and what we think Ella will say
                        the first time she meets her little sister 
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2x5XlmykQI/?img_index=1"> (here’s a video of the first time she met Emiliano)</a>.</p>
                        <p class="p3">This time around, though, we’re trying to decide on a name together. For inspiration, I’ve been clocking every woman’s
                        name that I hear on TV, read in books, and see on Instagram. We also looked at the U.S. Social Security’s 2023 list of
                        most popular names. The top 5 names for girls were:
                        <ul>
                          <li> Olivia</li>  
                           <li>Emma</li> 
                           <li> Charlotte</li>
                           <li> Amelia</li>
                           <li> Sophia</li>
                           
                        </ul>
                       
                        
                        The top 10 names for boys were:
                        <ul>
                          <li>  Liam</li>
                          <li>   Noah</li>
                           <li>  Oliver</li>
                        <li> James</li>
                        <li> Elijah</li>
